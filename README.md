### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± My name is Petter Carlsson. I am an imaginative coder with a passion for latin american dance and martial arts who spends his weekends helping the homeless cats of Stockholm.

ðŸŒ± A passion for coding led me to pursue web development after 8-years of working as an SEO and Web Analyst. The thrill of finally getting a piece of code to work after hours of frustration and the challenge of finding creative solutions to problems are what I love most about coding.

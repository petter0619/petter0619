### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± My name is Petter Carlsson. I am an imaginative coder with a passion for latin american dance and martial arts who spends his weekends helping the homeless cats of Stockholm.

ðŸŒ± A passion for coding led me to pursue web development after 8-years of working as an SEO and Web Analyst. The thrill of finally getting a piece of code to work after hours of frustration and the challenge of finding creative solutions to problems are what I love most about coding.

ðŸŒ± During Q1 2021 completed the </salt> (School of Applied Technology) Full-Stack Javascript Bootcamp. For a full list of the topics included in the bootcamp curriculum please visit: [salt.dev/about](https://salt.dev/about).
